# Message Board

![Message Board header](readme/images/message-board-header.png)

## Introduction
Message Board is a full-stack web application that allows users to post messages for others to see. Whether it’s a note of appreciation, a public announcement, or a simple thought to share, the site provides a clean and easy way to express yourself. Leveraging Django, Message Board seamlessly manages user authentication and message posting, all within a welcoming user experience.

Message Board is the result of a 3-day hackathon by a team of developers:

* Alex Aspinall
* Jess Howkins
* Jude Wools
* Kate Elliott

This project is open source and can be forked for customisation.  

A special edition of Message Board—**Thank You, Dillon!**—was built for us, and fellow students, to express our appreciation for Code Institute Facilitator Dillon Mc Caffrey. Deployed, documented, and delivered with gratitude.

## Agile

To ensure we delivered a minimum viable product (MVP) in the hackathon's allotted time frame, as a team we used MoSCoW prioritisation. Doing so allowed us to determine the MVP from the offset and work effectively to reach this first. The <a href="" target="_blank">project board</a> shows the complete user stories along with their acceptance criteria. The user stories are also laid out below within UX Design.

## Branding

### Fonts

Message Board uses 'Luckiest Guy' as a bold, mostly uppercase heading font and 'Shadows Into Light Two' for a body text that mimics handwriting. Both fonts are sourced from Google Fonts and there is a backup of 'sans-serif' applied on the site.

### Colour Palette

Message Board features a bold and vibrant colour palette, designed to create a welcoming and engaging experience. The chosen colours are carefully combined on the live site to ensure accessibility and readability.

## Deployment
- **Platform:** Heroku
- **High-Level Deployment Steps:** 
  1. Ensure project is set correctly for deployment
  2. Push code to Github
  3. Deploy from main in Heroku dashboard
- **Verification and Validation:**
  - All CRUD operations were retested manually in the deployed version. Often this was faster for making DB changes than spooling up the local server.
- **Security Measures:**
  - Use of environment variables for sensitive data.
  - Ensured DEBUG mode is disabled in production.
